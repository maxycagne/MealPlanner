# MealPlanner : 6-Hour Hackathon CodeFest Competition - Champion

📱 Description
MealPlanner is a mobile application developed by the our team for the Tagisan ng Talino 2025: Codefest - Local Level. The competition brought together the student from STI Tarlac Colleges.

Our team built MealPlanner in 6 hours during an on-site hackathon held at the Computer Labratory of STI College Tarlac. Competitors were required to stay within the venue for the entire duration of the hackathon.

To qualify for the Cluster Level, each team must first secure championships. Out of 12 teams in the STI College Tarlac, only 1 team earn the opportunity to compete in the next level.
